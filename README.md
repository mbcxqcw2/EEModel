# EEModel

A framework for analysing the excess dispersion measure (DM) component of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).

Allows testing of different host galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) models and constraining of FRB redshifts via their DMs.

The model makes use of FRBcat ((Petroff et al., 2016; arXiv:1601.03547; http://frbcat.org/), CAMB (https://camb.info/) and Planck Collaboration (arXiv:1502.01589) data.

A jupyter notebook containing the model and examples of its use can be launched using Binder:

The model is citable via Zenodo:
